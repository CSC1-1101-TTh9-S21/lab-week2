# Lab 1

You'll be going over this lab with your TA during your discussion section.

You do not need to turn in anything for this lab.

Don't forget that your TA will be taking attendance! Your attendance will contribute to your overall Class Participation grade. Students who routinely skip their discussion section will get a low grade, even if they come to class regularly. Class participation is worth 5% of your final grade, so getting a low score could be the difference between a an A and an A-.
